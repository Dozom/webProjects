# Create Table from txt to SQL
A simple script made when I was studying...

Our teacher told us to generate the data through a given EXCEL file.

The Excel file had a lot of lines I was a bit worried for the time i will spend there. Then i found a solution, 
make a script to reduce some time. I refactored years later, maybe could have changed the behaviour with NULLS,
but it works for me and I did it to practice, have fun and feel free to use it if you want.

## Steps:
1. Inside pet.txt, write the data separated by tabulations.
2. Run script.

**NOTE:**
If you want to use different fields, change the content of generate_insert_into() function.

Have fun and keep CODING! <3
