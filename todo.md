THINGS TO DO...
- Well, in order to keep working everyday to learn about software programming, I have created this TODO LIST just to have things in minds which I
can improve or do in the day. Every day I will updating the file.

under pythonProjects/banner_creator_python i have an old code which I can refactor in the morning before going to play bowling hehe.
Maybe I do some contributions tomorrow, but the main contrib will be this. 

BUT I KNOW YEAH I KNOW, I'M JUST TALKING TO MYSELF...
